	<p>This is my first Page as I pursue software engineering. I'm hoping that it can grow to be a better design from the intial and this is to remind me of my prgoress. Part of my first project is to create a page. </p>
	<p>My name is Ryan Santiago. I'm born and raised in New York City. I'm a big basketball fan and tend to gravitate toward sports. As I grew up I've always been intrested in tech. I've always wondered how things worked. And by that I mean I always wondered how everything worked. I didn't realize how amazed I was by tech until I started working at phone comapnies. It was then I realized thagt I can actually make money from my intrest in tech. But the more I was working with phones I realized that it was becoming more about selling and less about the beauty of the devices. Although I was great and loved selling as wellit just didn't captivate me as much as the actual functions of the phone. so at times I'd be there helping cosutomers configure their phones I often enjoyed the most challenging aspects of that. It was then I realized man I wonder how I can dice deeper into the functionality of apps websites and software. And then I started Youtubing how these very things I've spent so much time learning and using worked? Which is what lead me here to this very page! </p>
